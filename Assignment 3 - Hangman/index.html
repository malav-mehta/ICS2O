<!-- Hangman by Malav Mehta and Justin Lu (Tuesday, April 23, 2019, Mr. Hudson, ICS20-01).
	This game was created to explore the usage of JS Document Object Models, loops, and logic (selection, strings, etc.).
	
	The entire game is generated in JavaScript, through a series of <div> tags that we show or hide. This means that there is only one HTML file, and we simply hide or show different parts of the page, allowing for better performance.
	
	Elements.js contains the code for creating all the HTML elements in JS.

	Hangman.js contains the game's logic, as well as the functions needed to change between divs.

	Variables.js contains our global variables as well as our word lists.

	Stylesheet.css contains our styling.

	The images folder contains any images we used to create the project (background image on the splash screen.)

	The audio folder contains our background music and the sound effect for when there is a wrong guess.
