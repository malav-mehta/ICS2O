## About

This repository contains (nearly) all of the exercises and assignments I wrote for the ICS2O (grade 10 programming) class at my school.

## Running locally

Most of these works are simple HTML/JavaScript exercises that you can run directly by opening the root HTML file.

If you find any bugs or have any questions, email me: [malavhmehta@outlook.com](mailto:malavhmehta@outlook.com).
